# Real-world example: Employee Payslip Generator 

employee = "Sneha Gupta" 

basic_salary = 45000 

allowances = 8000 

deductions = 5500 

net_salary = basic_salary + allowances - deductions 

  

# METHOD 1: String Concatenation (OLD WAY — avoid) 

print("Employee: " + employee + " | Net: " + str(net_salary)) 

# Ugly — need str() for numbers, + signs everywhere 

  

# METHOD 2: .format() method (GOOD) 

print("Employee: {}  |  Net Salary: ₹{}".format(employee, net_salary)) 

  

# METHOD 3: f-strings (BEST — modern Python 3.6+) 

print(f"Employee: {employee}  |  Net Salary: ₹{net_salary}") 

  

# f-strings can include expressions! 

print(f"Basic: ₹{basic_salary:,}") 

print(f"Allowances: ₹{allowances:,}") 

print(f"Deductions: ₹{deductions:,}") 

print(f"Net Salary: ₹{net_salary:,}") 

print(f"Tax (10%): ₹{net_salary * 0.10:,.2f}")
