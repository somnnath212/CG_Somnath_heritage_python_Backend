# Case sensitivity demonstration 

name = "Rahul" 

Name = "Rahul Sharma" 

NAME = "R. SHARMA" 

  

print(name)   # Rahul 

print(Name)   # Rahul Sharma 

print(NAME)   # R. SHARMA 

  

# These are THREE completely different variables! 

  

# Common mistake: 

counter = 0 

Counter = counter + 1    # This creates a NEW variable 'Counter' 

print(counter)           # Still 0 — original unchanged! 

print(Counter)           # 1
